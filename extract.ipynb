      "There are only 18 species of chewing lice described from warblers of the family Parulidae (Aves: Passeriformes) (Price et al. 2003, Kounek et al. 2011). In North America, there are four recognized genera of chewing lice with species described on birds from the family Parulidae: Brueelia Kéler, 1936 (Ischnocera, Philopteridae), Menacanthus Neumann, 1912, Myrsidea Waterston, 1915 (Amblycera, Menoponidae), and Ricinus DeGeer, 1778 (Amblycera, Ricinidae) (Price et al. 2003). From these genera, only one species was described in the genus Brueelia—B. interposita (Kellogg, 1899)—from two species of Dendroica (Kellogg 1899, Cicchino 1983) and five species were described in the genus Myrsidea from warbler hosts (Palma and Price 2010, Kounek et al. 2011).\n",

      "The purpose of this paper is to describe two species of chewing lice found on the Swainson's warbler—Limnothlypis swainsonii (Audubon, 1834), a monotypic genus of the family Parulidae—composed by two species of the genera Myrsidea and Brueelia, described below. Up to the present, there are no records of any chewing lice from the Swainson's warbler (Price et al. 2003). We also provide a key for identification of females of species of Myrsidea parasitizing Parulidae.\n",
